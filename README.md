## About ✨
Reading Tracker is a RESTful API that helps you keep track of what you’re reading, what you've read, and what’s next on your list.

<br/>

## Features 🧩
- Reading status
- Optional start and finish date
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations

<br/>

## Installation 💻

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/liviadfsilva/ReadingTracker.git
   cd ReadingTracker
   ```

2. **Copy the .env.example file to .env and change the environment variables if necessary:**

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Build and start the application and database with Docker**

   ```bash
    docker compose up --build
   ```
<br/>

#### The application will start at:
꩜ **http://localhost:8000**

#### Access the Swagger documentation:
📜 **http://localhost:8000/docs**

<br/>

## Inspiration 💡
I believe the best way to learn is by building something real. This project started as a personal tool to track my reading progress while giving me a chance to practise FastAPI and work with a non-relational database.
